1. CODING AND NAMING STANDARDS

* Commenting will be used consistently throughout the application. Commenting is required as a minimum for the following code items:

	- Components
	- Functions
	- Constructors and Fields
	- Returns
	- Loops and Decisions

* Readability is critical and as such indentation and spacing will be used consistently across all JavaScript and CSS files. For example:

class Game extends Component {

	constructor() {
		super();
		this.state = {score: 0};
	}

}

* React components should be written in JSX format.

* Modularity throughout the application will ensure code is as reusable and will ensure that the application is efficient as possible. This means separating components and CSS files such  that multiple instances of components can be rendered throughout the application. There should be no more than one component per React file.

* Code must never be hardcoded and variables must always be passed up or down using the component's state or by utilising props. Apart from being an ethical consideration, hardcoding components is a security issue - irrespective of how sensitive the data is - and will be exempt from the application.

* Naming Conventions must be meaningful and relevant. DOM component prop names should be avoided when naming to minimise confusion (e.g. style= className=). Conventions will adhere to the following standards throughout the application:

	- Variables:  myName: "George" , var myName = "George";
	- Components: import Game from './Game';
	- Functions: opponentHand() { ...
	- Props: <Cards blankCard = "empty" />

* Version control is to be maintained throughout development and maintenance. Functionality that is that is still in development must branch off from master to ensure changes do not affect the working build of the application. These branches can then be merged later once finalised. Branches  must be appropriately named.

* Configuration is to be stored in environmental variables. This is to ensure that between stages of deployment they are not accidentally added into the code repository accidentally.

* Within the code repository, the application should make no association whether services are  run locally or via third party through our backend service CosmoDB - run from within the Azure suite.

* Back end services that will be used during deployment should also be used during the development stages. This will ensure that the system is as compatible as possible for deployment and will help to iron out any small problems with compatability.

* The game is based on an online session and as such the only data that should be stored is the login for the users. Any other data should be considered stateless and should have no  association external from that session.

* The output of the application should be routed to the console for monitoring of the behaviour of the application. Logs should also be stored in a file database so that any errors or inconsistencies can be tracked.

* Commit messages must be meaningful and specific to the iteration being pushed to the code repository.

* Mixins should not be within the application as they will cause unneeded dependencies, clashes and make the project unnecessarily complex.

* JSX attributes must always utilise double quotations "", meaning all other JSX items must use single quotations ''.
