1. CODING AND NAMING STANDARDS

* Commenting will be used consistently throughout the application. Commenting is required as 
a minimum for the following code items:

	- Components
	- Functions
	- Constructors and Fields
	- Returns
	- Loops and Decisions

* Readability is critical and as such indentation and spacing will be used consistently across all 
JavaScript and CSS files. For example:

class Game extends Component {

	constructor() {
		super();
		this.state = {score: 0};
	}

}

* Modularity throughout the application will ensure code is as reusable and will ensure that
the application is efficient as possible. This means separating components and CSS files such 
that multiple instances of components can be rendered throughout the application.

* Code must never be hardcoded and variables must always be passed up or down using the component's
state or by utlising props. Apart from being an ethical consideration, hardcoding components
is a security issue - irrespective of how sensitive the data is - and will be exempt from the 
application.

* Naming Conventions must be meaningful and relevant. Conventions will adhere to the following
standards throughout the application:

	- Variables:  myName: "George"
	- Components: class Game extends Component { ...
	- Functions: opponentHand() { ...

* Version control is to be maintained throughout development and maintenance. Functionality that is
that is still in development must branch off from master to ensure changes do not affect the
working build of the application. These branches can then be merged later once finalised. Branches 
must be appropriately named.

* Configuration is to be stored in environmental variables. This is to ensure that between
stages of deployment they are not accidentally added into the code repository accidentally.

* Within the code repository, the application should make no association whether services are 
run locally or via third party through our backend service CosmoDB - run from within the Azure
suite.

* Back end services that will be used during deployment should also be used during the development
stages. This will ensure that the system is as compatible as possible for deployment and will
help to iron out any small problems with compatability.


* The game is based on an online session and as such the only data that should be stored is
the login for the users. Any other data should be considered stateless and should have no 
association external from that session.

* // How will we handle port binding in our application?

* The output of the application should be routed to the console for monitoring of the behaviour of
the application. Logs should also be stored in a file database so that any errors or inconsistencies
can be tracked.

* Commit messages must be meaningful and specific to the iteration being pushed
to the code repository.
